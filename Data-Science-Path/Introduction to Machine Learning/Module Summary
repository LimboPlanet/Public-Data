Summary

We covered a lot of new jargon in this module. Letâ€™s recap what we've learned:

The goal of machine learning is to find patterns in data and use this to make estimates

Machine learning differs from normal software development in that we use special code, rather than our own intuition, to improve how well the software works.

The learning process conceptually uses four components:

Data about the topic we are interested in.

A model, which makes estimates.

An objective the model is trying to achieve.

An optimizer, which is the additional code that changes the model depending on its performance.

Data can be thought of as features, and labels. Features correspond to potential model inputs, while labels correspond to model outputs, or desired model outputs

Pandas and Plotly are powerful tools to explore datasets in Python

Once we have a trained model, we can save to disk for later use.
